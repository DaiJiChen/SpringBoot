## 2. Logging 

### Logging Framework

An abstract logging Framework and a concrete Framework
- Abstract Logging Layer: ~~JCL(too old)~~, ~~jboss-logging~~, SLF4J
- Concrete Implementation: ~~Log4j(LogBack is an improvement from Log4J)~~, Log4j2, LogBack

Spring use **JCL**

SpringBoot use **SLF4j** and **LogBack**

### SLF4j usage

```java
import org.slf4j.Logger;
import org.slf4j.LoggerFactory;

public class HelloWorld {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    Logger logger = LoggerFactory.getLogger(HelloWorld.class);
    logger.info("Hello World");
  }
}
```



### problem

How to keep a unified logging output when there are many kinds of different logging frameworks in our projectï¼Ÿ

For example: If a Project A (slf4j + logback) : Spring(Commoms-logging), Hibernate(jboss-logging), MyBatic, XXXX.

**Answer**
- 1. remove the original logging framework, replace with another framework
- 2. bridging modules which redirect calls made to log4j, JCL and java.util.logging APIs to behave as if they were made to the SLF4J API instead
- 3. import the framewrok we need.
